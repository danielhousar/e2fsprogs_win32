********************** E2FSPROGS for WIN32 ****************************

This should by port of e2fsprogs for MS Windows. I try to rewrite
incompatible code of e2fsprogs, but I want to let the most of code
untouched for compatibility with original code.

This port should be mergeable with original code by GIT (or at least
something will be mergeable - for less work).

	---------------------------- STATUS -------------------------------

Now derived from: 1.41.14 (GIT: master 2011-05-15)

Status description:
	- mostly compillable (with some rewrites of Makefiles)
	- compillable all main needed binaries (libext2fs, mke2fs, e2fsck)
	- not linkable: missing symbols errors (maybe bad or missing exports)

Compillable by MinGW GCC (>= 4.4.0) under Msys environment (Win32 + Bash + unix paths):

	lib/e2p:	libe2p.a
	lib/et:		libcomm_err.a
	lib/ext2fs:	libext2fs.a
	lib/blkid:	libblkid.a
	e2fsck:		*.o
	misc:		mke2fs

Substitute binaries:
	(origin) - (substitute)
	lib/uuid: libuuid.a - MinGW: libuuid.a

Linkable (with no missing symbols):

Working (with no runtime errors):

Finalised (doing its work fine):
