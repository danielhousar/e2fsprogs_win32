********************** E2FSPROGS for WIN32 ****************************

This should by port of e2fsprogs for MS Windows. I try to rewrite
incompatible code of e2fsprogs, but I want to let the most of code
untouched for compatibility with original code.

This port should be mergeable with original code by GIT (or at least
something will be mergeable - for less work).

	---------------------------- STATUS -------------------------------

Now derived from: 1.41.14 (GIT: master 2011-05-15)

Description:
	- mostly compillable (with some rewrites of Makefiles)
	- compillable all main needed binaries (libext2fs, mke2fs, e2fsck)
	- not linkable: missing symbols errors (maybe bad or missing exports)

TODO:
	- solve mising-symbol errors during link
	- make mke2fs and e2fsck compatible with NT disk-IO ABI
	- test mke2fs if making Ext4fs on partition correctly

Compillable by MinGW GCC (>= 4.4.0) under Msys environment (Win32 + Bash):

	lib/e2p:	libe2p.a
	lib/et:		libcomm_err.a
	lib/ext2fs:	libext2fs.a
	lib/blkid:	libblkid.a
	lib/uuid:	libuuid.a
	e2fsck:		e2fsck.o
	misc:		mke2fs.o

Linkable (with no missing symbols):

Running (executable):

Working (with no runtime errors):

Finalised (doing its work fine):
